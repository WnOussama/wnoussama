# Generated Stats Images

This folder contains automatically generated GitHub statistics images.

The images are generated by the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/generate-stats.yml`.

## Files

- `overview.svg` - Overview of GitHub statistics (stars, forks, contributions, etc.)
- `languages.svg` - Programming languages breakdown

These images are automatically updated daily via GitHub Actions.

## Setup Required

To generate these images, you need to:

1. Create a personal access token with `read:user` and `repo` permissions
2. Add the token as a repository secret named `ACCESS_TOKEN`
3. Run the "Generate Stats Images" workflow manually or wait for the scheduled run
